# 🎓 Motivise – Study Micro-Blogging Platform (Backend)

Motivise is a small social platform where students can share short learning updates, daily progress, motivation, and study tips.
It’s like a learning diary that helps students stay motivated and connect with others who are also studying.

## 🌟 Main Idea
Students can post short “micro-blog” updates about what they studied today.
Each post can include:
- text about what they did
- images of notes or whiteboards
- short PDF files (like cheat sheets)
- study tags (e.g., #math, #marketing)

Other students can like or comment on posts.
Optional “study streaks” show how many days in a row a user has been learning.
